Load the project in Unity using the 'AI Project' folder.
Once the project is loaded, load the Scene, named 'World', which is in the 'Assets/Scenes' directory of the project.
Once the scene is loaded, press the Play button in the top-center of the Unity editor to start up a preview of the current scene.
The camera will follow the Player character from a 3rd person angle, you are controlling the camera, not the player using WASD + mouse movement.
You can switch between a world view and the 3rd person view with the 'C' key.
